Why hasn't the mmw communication been widely used?

high propagation loss, small coverage
multipath, mobility --> fading channel
high costs on the infrastructure and networks

how to achieve reliable communication over fading channels?

interference --> MAC protocoles: TDMA, CDMA, OFDMA, random Access
fading channels --> PHY Techniques: equalization, OFDM, MIMO
small size of terminals --> other techniques not covered in this course

channel modeling: linear time invariant (LTI) 

bit error and spectrem efficiency

You can use $$\LaTeX$$ to typeset formulas. A formula can be displayed inline, e.g. $$e=mc^2$$, or as a block:
$$\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v~dx = \int_\Omega fv~dx$$
