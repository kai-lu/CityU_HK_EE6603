Why hasn't the mmw communication been widely used?

high propagation loss, small coverage
multipath, mobility --> fading channel
high costs on the infrastructure and networks

how to achieve reliable communication over fading channels?

interference --> MAC protocoles: TDMA, CDMA, OFDMA, random Access
fading channels --> PHY Techniques: equalization, OFDM, MIMO
small size of terminals --> other techniques not covered in this course
